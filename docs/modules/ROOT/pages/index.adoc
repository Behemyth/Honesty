=== Suites

Suites are statically tracked and must be created via the `Suite` class. Their input is a callable that in turn must return a generator object to asynchronously generate tests.

auto suiteGenerator = [](){};

Suite suite("Example Suite", suiteGenerator);

=== Sets

The top-level suite callable can also host a test section that allows for parameterization of tests
